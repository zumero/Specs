summary: A persistent, serial task queue for iOS.
description: |2
                      IPOfflineQueue is a persistent, serial task queue for iOS. It's especially ideal for queuing actions that require an internet connection that may be slow or absent.

                      * You enqueue tasks to it, and they run whenever they can in a background thread.
                      * Tasks are always executed in the order in which they were added (FIFO).
                      * Tasks are __not__ executed in parallel, although you are free to run parallel operations in your task-execution handler.
                      * Queued tasks persist between application launches.
                      * The application will remain running in the background until the queue completes or until iOS kills it (after no more than 10 minutes).
                      * You're welcome to operate multiple queue instances if you'd like to run different tasks.
                      * GCD is used extensively to prevent blocking the main thread.
