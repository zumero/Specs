  \       bar\\n    )\\n}\"\n    don't you understand?\n\n    Apple has documented
  that NSArray, NSDictionary, NSSet, and friends should\n    honor the descriptionWithLocale:indent:
  method should it be present in an\n    object, printing that object without newline-escaping
  it or anything.\n    Well, ever since Snow Leopard, it doesn't for \"security reasons.\"
  This is\n    a quick swizzle (or category-based replacement, depending on your\n
  \   preference) which adds it back. Because your objects are beautiful (so are\n
  \   you) and they deserve the limelight, too!\n  "
