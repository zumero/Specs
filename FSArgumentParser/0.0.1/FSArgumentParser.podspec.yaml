description: Parsing command-line arguments is hard, but it doesn't have to be! FSArgumentParser
  makes it much easier to parse command-line arguments by defining a declarative argument
  signature which some magic box code interprets. It handles the presence of missing
  arguments, detecting short and long names, and packaging it all up in a simple,
  easy to use object. So go write command-line tools like a boss, and keep being awesome!
