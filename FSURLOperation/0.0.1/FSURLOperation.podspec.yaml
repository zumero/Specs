description: HTTP requests are hard, but scheduling them doesn't have to be! FSURLOperation
  makes it much easier to dispatch NSURLRequests. By leveraging the existing capabilities
  of NSOperation, you can set dependencies, block until an operation (or set of operations)
  completes, and also control which thread the request is performed on. So go make
  concurrent URL operations like a boss, and keep being awesome!
